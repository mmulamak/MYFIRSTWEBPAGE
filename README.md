# MYFIRSTWEBPAGE

This is my first web page created as part of my Git and github learning lab .
I built this project 'brick by brick' to practice creating repositories, branching , commiting, pushing to Github, merging branches.
I look forward to improving this website and learning more about web development and version control , during my time at Perscholas!
